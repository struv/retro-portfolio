        const articleContent = `Look, I know starting a company where your childhood friend's brother wants you dead sounds stupid. And yeah, technically it is. But in my defense, the idea was good.

We were all crammed into the La Cañada house—my house, technically, now that my parents had long since moved out and I was pretending to be an adult who owned property. Jonny was perched on the armrest of the old green couch like a nervous bird. Josh had commandeered the entire coffee table with his laptop and a disturbingly organized spreadsheet. And Kevin? Kevin was meticulously cleaning a pocket knife with the focus of a bomb squad technician.

"So," I said, clapping my hands together. They didn't look up. "Valley Pediatric AI Solutions. Good name, right?"

Josh's eyes flicked from his screen to me, a silent, devastating critique. "It's descriptive."

"It's a mouthful," Kevin muttered, not looking up from his blade.

Jonny just shifted his weight. "The… the receptionist at Sun Valley said their system is all paper files. Actual, physical paper. It's 2024. It's a crime."

That was the opening. That was the tiny, ridiculous crack in the universe we were going to shove our entire future into.

"Right," I said, pacing the worn Persian rug. "So we build them a simple, secure intake form. Parents fill it out on a tablet in the waiting room. AI cross-references symptoms with their records, flags potential allergies, drug interactions, the whole deal. Saves nurses hours. Makes them look like heroes."

"Makes us look like geniuses," Kevin said, finally sheathing the knife. His version of a business plan usually involved more hardware than software, but he was coming around.

Josh tapped a key. "Initial development cost is manageable. Hosting, not so much. The real expense is liability insurance. If our AI tells a doctor a kid isn't allergic to penicillin and, well… you know."

We all sat in the heavy silence of that 'you know.'

"We'll get the insurance," I said, with a confidence I absolutely did not feel. "We'll demo it for free. We get one clinic, then another. We'll be the friendly neighborhood tech guys. The… uh…"

"The Lions of Paradise," Jonny said softly.

The old name landed in the middle of the room like a ghost. Our old Boy Scout troop. Back when the biggest threat we faced was poison oak and running out of marshmallows.

Kevin smirked. "Hell yeah. Sounds like a biker gang. I like it."

"It sounds like a metaphor waiting to happen," Josh corrected, but he was smiling a little. He opened a new tab. "I'll register the LLC."

This was it. This was the moment it went from a stupid idea in my head to a real, stupid thing we were actually doing. The air in the room changed, charged with that specific mix of terror and possibility. We were building something. Together.

And the tightness in my chest, the one that had been my constant companion for the past six months, squeezed a little tighter. Because building something meant leaving the house. It meant going out there.

Jonny was staring at me, his head tilted like he was listening to a distant radio frequency. "You're scared."

"I'm pragmatically assessing risk," I shot back, a little too quickly.

"You haven't left La Cañada in three months, Will," Josh said, not looking up from his screen. It wasn't an accusation. It was a data point.

"The valley's different," I said, my voice dropping. "You know it's different."

The Bishop family ran the Valley. Not the tech valley. The other one. The one with territory and rules and consequences. And Isaac Bishop, who I used to build blanket forts with, who I'd punched in the face the last time we spoke, was the heir to all of it. His older brother Alex… well. Alex was the reason I hadn't left La Cañada in three months.

Kevin leaned forward, his elbows on his knees. "Alex Bishop's a punk. We can handle him."

"He's not a punk, Kevin. He's a capitalist with a supply chain that happens to be illegal. There's a difference." I ran a hand through my hair. "Look, the point is, we're not going to the Valley to start a war. We're going to start a business. We'll be quiet. Professional. Invisible."

Three faces looked back at me with varying degrees of disbelief.

I sighed, the weight of the unspoken truth making my shoulders ache. They thought they knew the story. They knew the broad strokes—the fight, the threats, the reason I jumped at shadows in my own hometown.

But they didn't know the beginning. They didn't know how it started with a borrowed laptop and a stupid, curious click on a file I was never meant to see.

I should probably mention why I can't go to the Valley. But first, you need to understand how we got here.`;
