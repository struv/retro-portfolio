        const articleContent = `Look, I know starting a company where your childhood friend's psychotic brother wants you dead sounds like the dumbest idea since that time Kevin tried to hotwire a golf cart at scout camp. And yeah, technically it was. But in my defense, the actual business idea was solid—it was the geography that needed work.

We were crammed into Jonny's parents' place in La Cañada—this sprawling Tudor-style house that smelled like lemon polish and old money. They'd let me crash in the guest house while I "consulted" for their pediatric group, which mostly meant resetting passwords and trying not to stare at the family portrait where everyone looked like they'd just returned from a very successful yachting expedition.

Jonny was perched on the armrest of some antique velvet couch that probably cost more than my entire CS degree, looking like a nervous crane about to take flight. Josh had commandeered the marble coffee table with his laptop and a disturbingly detailed spreadsheet that probably had formulas for optimal breath mint consumption. And Kevin? Kevin was meticulously disassembling a Glock with the focus of a bomb squad technician who really, really loved his job.

"So," I said, clapping my hands together. They didn't look up. "Valley Pediatric AI Solutions. Doesn't sound like something that'll get us shot, right?"

Josh's eyes flicked from his screen to me, that special look he reserves for particularly bad ideas and people who misuse Excel. "It's descriptive."

"Sounds like a pharmaceutical company that gets sued," Kevin muttered, not looking up from his slide assembly. "We should call it something cooler. Like Pediatric HIT Team."

Jonny shifted his weight, the velvet groaning beneath him. "The receptionist at Sun Valley Pediatrics said their system is all paper files. Actual, physical paper. It's 2024. It's a crime against humanity." He said it with the righteous fury of someone whose family invented electronic medical records.

That was our opening. That tiny, ridiculous crack in the universe where we were going to shove our entire future and possibly our dental records.

"Right," I said, pacing across Persian rugs that had probably never known the tread of someone wearing discount sneakers. "So we build them a simple, secure intake form. Parents fill it out on a tablet in the waiting room. AI cross-references symptoms with records, flags potential allergies, drug interactions—saves nurses hours. Makes them look like heroes."

"Makes us look like geniuses who deserve hazard pay," Kevin said, finally snapping his Glock back together. His version of a business plan usually involved more ballistic nylon than software, but he was coming around.

Josh tapped a key. "Initial development cost is manageable if Will works for free—which he currently is. Hosting, not so much. The real expense is liability insurance. If our AI tells a doctor a kid isn't allergic to penicillin and, well..." He didn't need to finish. We all sat in the heavy silence of that unspoken tragedy, the ghost of a lawsuit already haunting Jonny's perfectly decorated living room.

"We'll get the insurance," I said, with the confidence of someone who'd just maxed out his last credit card. "We'll demo it for free. Get one clinic, then another. We'll be the friendly neighborhood tech guys. The... uh..."

"The Lions of Paradise," Jonny said softly.

The old name landed in the room like a grenade with the pin still in. Our Boy Scout troop. Back when the biggest threats were poison oak and running out of marshmallows. Back when Isaac Bishop was just my friend who couldn't tie a proper square knot, not the heir apparent to a criminal empire.

Kevin smirked. "Hell yeah. Sounds like a biker gang that does pediatric care. I'm in."

"It sounds like a metaphor waiting to happen," Josh corrected, but he was already opening a new tab. "I'll register the LLC. Because apparently we're doing this."

This was it. The moment it went from a stupid idea in my anxiety-riddled brain to a real, legally-registered stupid thing we were actually doing. The air in the room changed, charged with that specific mix of terror and possibility that usually precedes either a startup or a hostage situation.

We were building something. Together.

And the tightness in my chest—the one that had been my constant companion since that night at Hansen Dam—squeezed a little tighter. Because building something meant leaving this safe, lavender-scented bubble. It meant going out there.

Jonny was staring at me, his head tilted like he was listening to a distant radio frequency only he could hear. "You're scared."

"I'm pragmatically assessing risk profiles in a volatile market," I shot back, a little too quickly.

"You haven't left La Cañada in three months, Will," Josh said, not looking up from his screen. It wasn't an accusation. Just a data point in the spreadsheet of my slowly collapsing life.

"The valley's different," I said, my voice dropping to a near-whisper. "You know it's different."

The Bishop family ran the Valley. Not the tech valley where people argued about blockchain over twelve-dollar lattes. The other one. The one with territory lines and rules written in blood and consequences that didn't come in the form of venture capital meetings. And Isaac, who I used to build blanket forts with, who I'd punched in the face the last time we spoke, was being groomed to take over all of it.

His older brother Alex... well. Alex was the reason I'd been basically under house arrest in the nicest guest room in La Cañada.

Kevin leaned forward, his elbows on his knees. "Alex Bishop's a punk with a nice car. We can handle him."

"He's not a punk, Kevin. He's a capitalist with a supply chain that happens to be illegal and a body count that definitely is. There's a difference." I ran a hand through my hair. "Look, the point is, we're not going to the Valley to start a war. We're going to start a business. We'll be quiet. Professional. Invisible."

Three faces looked back at me with varying degrees of disbelief. Jonny's slightly concerned, Josh's clinically skeptical, Kevin's already calculating optimal sight lines for a firefight.

They thought they knew the story. They knew the broad strokes—the fight, the threats, the reason I jumped at shadows in my own hometown. But they didn't know the beginning. They didn't know how it started with a borrowed laptop and a stupid, curious click on a file labeled "FAMILY BUSINESS - DO NOT OPEN."

I should probably mention why Alex Bishop wants me dead. But first, you need to understand how four former boy scouts decided the San Fernando Valley criminal underworld was the perfect place to launch a healthcare startup.`;
